How to form a team:

  1) Designate a team coordinator.

  2) Have the coordinator fork this repository.

  3) Create a directory in your fork with your team name (in lower case, with
     underscores instead of spaces).

  4) In your team directory, create a file called "members.txt". For each team
     member:
       Find that persons name in the students.txt file and copy *the whole line*
       into members.txt (preserve the student number, tabs etc.) using copy
       and paste (*do not type a subset of the line in manually*).

  5) In your team directory, create a file called "coordinator.txt" which
     contains the coordinator's line from students.txt (copy and paste
     *the whole line*, as in step 4).

  7) In your team directory, create a file "repo.txt" which has the
     URL to the public githup repository you will be using for development
     during your project.

     [Note: if the repository changes at any point, you must make a pull request
     to update this link.]

  8) Add the files you have created, commit them, and push them to your fork.

  8) Send a pull request.

If you get any of these details wrong, you will be asked to try again.
